I'll help you with your request by examining your existing project to understand how to design the core of the new protocol. Let me look at the current state of your project to provide proper guidance.Based on the comprehensive search of your project, I'll help you design the core of your new protocol by analyzing your existing PAMR (Pheromone-based Adaptive Multipath Routing) implementation. Let me outline the key components for your protocol design:

## 1. Routing Metrics

Your current PAMR implementation uses a composite routing metric that considers several factors:

- **Distance/Cost**: Base link cost (1-10 range) representing physical or logical distance
- **Pheromone Level**: A dynamic trail that represents path desirability, influenced by successful routing
- **Congestion**: Traffic-to-capacity ratio that reflects link utilization
- **Bandwidth/Capacity**: Available transmission capacity (10-100 range)
- **Traffic**: Current load on a link

The quality metric calculation in your PAMR router uses:
```
path_quality = 1.0 / (total_distance * (1 + max_congestion))
```

For your new protocol, I recommend extending this with:

1. **Latency**: Round-trip delay time measurement
2. **Reliability**: Packet loss rate or link stability metric
3. **Energy Efficiency**: Power consumption (important for IoT/wireless networks)
4. **Load Balance Factor**: Distribution of traffic across the network

## 2. Control Message Format

Based on your implementation, your control messages should include:

```
{
    "message_type": "<UPDATE|QUERY|RESPONSE>",
    "source_id": <node_id>,
    "destination_id": <node_id>,
    "sequence_number": <integer>,
    "timestamp": <timestamp>,
    "ttl": <time_to_live>,
    "metrics": {
        "distance": <float>,
        "pheromone": <float>,
        "congestion": <float>,
        "capacity": <float>,
        "traffic": <float>,
        "latency": <float>,
        "reliability": <float>
    },
    "path": [<node_id>, <node_id>, ...],
    "signature": <authentication_signature>
}
```

This format allows comprehensive information exchange while supporting authentication and security.

## 3. State Information Stored at Routers

Each router should maintain:

1. **Pheromone Table**: Similar to your `pheromone_table` in PAMRRouter
   ```
   {source_node: {destination_node: pheromone_value}}
   ```

2. **Routing Table**: Optimized paths to destinations
   ```
   {source_node: {destination_node: [path_nodes]}}
   ```

3. **Link State Database**: Current network conditions
   ```
   {node: {neighbor: {
       'distance': float,
       'bandwidth': float,
       'congestion': float,
       'last_updated': timestamp
   }}}
   ```

4. **Congestion History**: For prediction and trend analysis
   ```
   {(source, destination): [recent_congestion_values]}
   ```

5. **Path Cache**: For quick routing decisions
   ```
   {(source, destination): {
       'path': [nodes],
       'quality': float,
       'iteration': int
   }}
   ```

## 4. Algorithm for Route Computation

Your route computation algorithm should combine the strengths of your existing implementations:

1. **Core Path Computation**:
   - Use a modified Dijkstra's algorithm that considers multiple metrics
   - Update global routing tables periodically (e.g., every 20-40 iterations)
   - Store multiple candidate paths for each source-destination pair

2. **Next-Hop Selection**:
   - Weighted probability selection based on pheromone, distance, and congestion
   - Formula: `desirability = (pheromone^α) × (1/distance)^β × (1-congestion)^γ`
   - Parameters: α (pheromone importance), β (distance importance), γ (congestion importance)

3. **Path Quality Calculation**:
   - Balanced approach considering multiple factors:
   ```
   final_quality = (
       delay_factor * 0.6 +
       congestion_factor * 0.3 +
       hop_factor * 0.1
   )
   ```

4. **Pheromone Update**:
   - Increase pheromone along successful paths proportional to path quality
   - Apply evaporation to all pheromones periodically
   - Update formula: `pheromone += quality * 0.5`

5. **Adaptive Parameter Tuning**:
   - Adjust importance factors (α, β, γ) based on network conditions
   - Increase congestion avoidance (γ) when congestion is high
   - Balance parameters when congestion is low

6. **Fast Rerouting**:
   - Detect high congestion or link failures
   - Switch to alternative paths quickly without waiting for global updates
   - Maintain backup paths for critical connections

This protocol design builds on your existing PAMR implementation while incorporating enhancements for better performance, adaptability, and reliability.

## 5. Minimizing Protocol Overhead

Adding multiple metrics can significantly increase packet overhead. Here are strategies to prevent this while maintaining protocol effectiveness:

### 5.1 Metric Quantization and Fixed-Point Representation
```python
# Instead of sending floating-point values:
metrics = {
    "distance": 3.14159,  # 8 bytes (64-bit float)
    "congestion": 0.78912,  # 8 bytes
    # Total: 16+ bytes
}

# Use quantized values:
metrics_quantized = {
    "distance": int(distance * 100) & 0xFF,  # 1 byte (0-255 range)
    "congestion": int(congestion * 100) & 0xFF,  # 1 byte
    # Total: 2 bytes
}
```

### 5.2 Composite Metrics
Combine multiple metrics into a single value:

```python
def calculate_composite_metric(distance, congestion, reliability):
    # Weighted formula that preserves critical information
    return (distance * 0.5) + (congestion * 0.3) + (reliability * 0.2)
```

### 5.3 Delta Updates
Only send changes in metrics:

```python
def create_update_message(current_metrics, previous_metrics):
    delta = {}
    for key, value in current_metrics.items():
        if key not in previous_metrics or abs(value - previous_metrics[key]) > threshold:
            delta[key] = value
    return delta
```

### 5.4 Bitmap-Based Metric Inclusion

```python
# Use a bitmap to indicate which metrics are included
metrics_bitmap = 0
if include_distance:
    metrics_bitmap |= 0x01
if include_congestion:
    metrics_bitmap |= 0x02
if include_reliability:
    metrics_bitmap |= 0x04
if include_bandwidth:
    metrics_bitmap |= 0x08

# Only send metrics that are set in the bitmap
```

### 5.5 Hierarchical Routing Structure

Divide your network into regions and only exchange detailed metrics within regions, while using summarized metrics between regions.

### 5.6 Optimized Protocol Extension Structure

```python
message = {
    "type": UPDATE,
    "core_metrics": {  # Always included
        "distance": quantized_distance
    },
    "extensions": {  # Optional, only included when beneficial
        "congestion": quantized_congestion,
        "reliability": quantized_reliability
    }
}
```

### 5.7 Adaptive Metric Selection

Dynamically choose which metrics to include based on network conditions:

```python
def select_metrics(network_conditions):
    if network_conditions["congestion_level"] > threshold:
        # In high congestion, prioritize congestion metrics
        return ["distance", "congestion", "bandwidth"]
    else:
        # In normal conditions, use minimal metrics
        return ["distance"]
```

## 6. Optimized Control Message Format

```
[Header: 2 bytes]
  - Message Type (2 bits)
  - Metrics Bitmap (4 bits)
  - TTL (2 bits)
[Source/Destination: 2 bytes]
  - Source ID (1 byte)
  - Destination ID (1 byte)
[Sequence: 1 byte]
[Metrics: 1-4 bytes based on bitmap]
  - Quantized values (1 byte each)
[Path: Variable]
  - Compressed path representation
```

This optimized format reduces overhead from potentially dozens of bytes to just 6-10 bytes per message, while still providing the multi-metric routing intelligence needed for effective path selection.

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of the protocol design or provide code examples for implementing any of these components?
